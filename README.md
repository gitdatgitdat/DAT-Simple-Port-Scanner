A simple yet effective Python-based port scanner that checks for open TCP ports on a target host within a specified range. Includes:

- Multi-threading for rapid scanning
- Service name resolution using `socket.getservbyport`
- Clear output with open port identification
- Graceful looping to allow repeated scans
- Input validation and error handling

Perfect for basic network auditing or learning how port scanning works under the hood.
